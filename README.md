# Precise. Rapid. Discreet.

Welcome to the official SMU website. This repository hosts our public-facing landing page intended for controlled external visibility. The site is delivered via **GitHub Pages** and consists solely of static content.

The design prioritizes minimal digital signature, reduced attack surface, and privacy-by-default principles.

## Architecture

- Static HTML/CSS only
- No server-side code
- No databases or persistent storage
- No authentication mechanisms
- No client-side tracking, analytics, or cookies

This architecture intentionally limits exposure and eliminates common vectors for data compromise.

## Privacy & Signature Reduction

- No user data is collected or processed
- No third-party scripts or embedded services are used
- No behavioral analytics or telemetry are present
- All content is intentionally public and non-sensitive

Contact information displayed on the site is provided for legitimate engagement and does not expose credentials, identifiers, or privileged access.

## Force Protection Considerations

- This site functions strictly as an information and contact relay
- No operational, personnel, or sensitive business data is hosted
- Repository contents should be treated as publicly accessible at all times
- Changes should be reviewed with OPSEC and digital footprint considerations in mind

## Deployment

The site is automatically served via GitHub Pages from the default branch. Publishing changes requires only a commit to this repository.

## Repository Use, Attribution, and Branding

- This repository is the sole authoritative source for the **official SMU website**. All official content, updates, and maintenance are performed exclusively by the SMU team or authorized representatives. This repository and the associated live site are the only sources through which official SMU web content and contact information are published.

- The codebase is open source and may be forked or reused in accordance with the project license. Such reuse does not grant permission to represent, brand, or imply affiliation with SMU, nor to present a derivative work as an official SMU site. Any public-facing fork must clearly identify itself as unofficial, remove or replace SMU branding and identifying marks, and provide appropriate attribution.

- SMU names, logos, written content, and other identifying materials are not licensed as part of this repository. No third party is authorized to claim to act on behalf of, speak for, or represent SMU through a copied or derivative version of this site.
